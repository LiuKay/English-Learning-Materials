Asking questions
about project specifics

Product 1

Alex's first day at the company, meeting
with the team manager Sam and
experienced developer Riley to discuss
Product 1 (Website Redesign for
Handmade Crafts Store).

Listen to the questions
about project specifics
in this dialogue.

DIALOGUE

R: Our project is a website redesign focusing on enhancing the user experience
for a crafts store. We’re in the requirements gathering phase.
A: Hey, I'm Alex. I'll be working on front-end development. Are we focusing on
anything specific for this project?
R: Yes, we're focusing on responsive design and accessibility. For the front-end,
we're using HTML5, CSS3 for structuring and styling, and React for a dynamic,
interactive user experience. This will help us build reusable components and
manage the application's state effectively.
A: How do we plan to handle customer feedback and user input?
R: We plan to conduct surveys and maybe some focus groups. It’s important we
understand the user journey from their perspective.
S: Right. Alex, you’ll start by getting acquainted with our front-end workflow.
Any questions?
A: What’s the timeline for the initial prototype?
S: We're aiming for a prototype in the next six weeks. We will meet regularly to
track progress and address any challenges.
A: Sounds good. I’m anxious to contribute and work with everyone.

To address feedback from
stakeholders / customers.

This means to listen to the
feedback, directly respond to it,
and make changes based on what
was suggested.

Gather Feedback: Collect what
 people think and suggest.

Analyze Input: Look at what everyone
 said to find patterns and useful ideas.

Incorporate Suggestions: Use good ideas
from people to make the product better.

Respond to Feedback: Let people know you heard
them and tell them how you'll use their ideas.

Prioritize Changes: Choose the most
important feedback to work on first.

How do we handle customer feedback and user input?

1: “We start by gathering feedback directly
 from stakeholders in our sprint review meetings.”

2: “After collecting it, we analyze the input to
 identify key themes and actionable insights.”

3: “We make sure to incorporate suggestions that align
with our project's objectives into the next sprint's
planning.”

4: “It's important to respond to stakeholder feedback, so
we follow up with them to discuss how their input is
being addressed.”

5: “Lastly, we prioritize changes based on the feedback's
importance and urgency, ensuring the most critical
updates are implemented first.”

What’s the timeline
 for the initial prototype?

Can you tell me the schedule
for the first prototype's completion?

What is the projected timeframe for
developing the initial prototype?

 What is the deadline
for the initial prototype?

Timeline: This is about marking when
things should start and when they
should finish on a calendar.

Schedule: This is planning exactly
when you'll work on different parts of
your project.

Timeframe: This is about how long
you have to do something. If you have
a week to finish a project, that week is
your timeframe.

Deadline: This is the last day and time
you can finish something. If your
project needs to be done by Friday at 5
PM, that's your deadline.

The schedule for our initial prototype is
estimated to be around / about  8 weeks.

The timeline is to complete
 the first prototype within / in
approximately 2 months.

The deadline for the initial prototype of
our supply chain management platform
is set at 14 weeks.

Alex, working on Product 2 (Enterprise-

Platform), seeks clarifications from fellow
developer Kim and Scrum Master Jordan.

DIALOGUE

A: I'm reviewing the user stories for the supplier integration module. Some of the technical requirements are
not very clear. Could you clarify them for me?
K:. What specifically do you need clarification on?
A: For the real-time inventory tracking feature, are we pulling data directly from the suppliers’ systems or
through a centralized database?
K: Good question. We’re integrating directly with the suppliers' systems using APIs. This allows us to access
real-time data without significant delays.
A: Got it. And what about handling different data formats from various suppliers?
K: We're planning to use a middleware solution that standardizes the data formats before they are processed
by our system.
A: That makes sense. Thanks for clarifying that. Another thing, how are we ensuring data security during
these integrations?
K: Data security is a priority. We’re using encrypted channels for all data transfers and implementing OAuth
for secure authentication.
A: Getting these clarifications helps me understand the scope better.

Let’s look at ways to politely say;

To Standardize Data: Make
data follow the same rules.

To Cleanse Data: Clean
or fix data mistakes.

To manage diverse supplier data for our
website redesign, we'll normalize data for
consistency, cleanse inaccuracies and
duplicates, and use schema mapping to
integrate all supplier data seamlessly.

For our supply chain platform, we'll
standardize supplier data through
normalization, ensure data integrity via
validation and cleansing, and integrate all
data with schema mapping for real-time
insights and decision-making.

In our real estate portal, we'll normalize
property details for uniform listings,
validate and cleanse data for accuracy,
and integrate listings from various

Asking questions
 about the tech stack

Product 1

Evelyn, a developer, is discussing the tech
stack for Product 1 (Website Redesign for
Handmade Crafts Store) with fellow
developer Charlie.

DIALOGUE

E: I'm just trying to get a better understanding of our tech stack for the website redesign.
Can you walk me through our main technologies?
C: Sure, Evelyn. We're mainly using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. For the frontend, we
decided on React because of its component-based architecture, which is great for our
dynamic content needs.
E: That makes sense. Are we using any specific libraries or frameworks with React?
C: Yes, we're incorporating Redux for state management and React Router for navigation.
We’re also using Sass for more efficient CSS coding.
E: Got it. And what about the backend? Are we integrating with any CMS?
C: We're going with a headless CMS approach, potentially with Contentful. It gives us
more flexibility with our front-end design and is great for content management.
E: Ok, what’s our approach to responsive design and accessibility?
D: For responsive design, we're focusing on a mobile-first approach. Accessibility is also
key, so we’re ensuring compliance with WCAG standards.
E:. Are there any specific development tools or environments we're using?
C: We're using Visual Studio Code as our primary IDE. For version control, we’ve chosen
Git with GitHub for collaboration. We're also setting up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.

How about the backend? Are there any
particular technologies or databases in
play?

On the backend, are there specific
technologies or databases we're using?

For the front-end development, we’re using Bootstrap
and jQuery to ensure responsive design and enhanced
user experience. For the backend we're incorporating
WordPress as our content management system (CMS) to
streamline content updates.

For the back-end we’re relying on Node.js and
Express.js for building robust APIs. Furthermore,
we're using React.js for the user interface, and
D3.js for advanced data visualization within the
application.

On the front-end, we're employing Angular for
building a responsive and dynamic user interface.
For the back-end, we’re utilizing Django, a
Python-based framework known for its
versatility and security features.
