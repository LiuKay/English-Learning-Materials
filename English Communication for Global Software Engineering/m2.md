Stan, a new developer on Product 2
(Enterprise-Level Supply Chain
Management Platform), is being
introduced to the design and testing tools
by senior developer Mike and QA engineer
Jenna.

M: Hey today I’m going to walk you through the tools we use for our supply chain
platform's design.
M: We start with Figma for our UI/UX designs. It’s a collaborative interface design tool.
You can see real-time edits and leave feedback directly on the design drafts.
S: Are the designs then handed over to the development team?
M: Exactly. We use Zeplin for handoff. It helps bridge the gap between designers and
developers by providing specs, assets, and code snippets.
S: What about the testing tools?
J: Hi, I'm the QA Engineer. For testing, we use a combination of manual and automated
tools. Selenium is our go-to for automated testing, especially for regression and
functional tests.
S: I’ve worked with Selenium before. Do we integrate it with any CI/CD tools?
J: Yes, we integrate Selenium tests into our Jenkins pipeline. It helps us automate the
testing process as part of continuous integration.
S: What about performance and load testing?
M: For performance, we rely on JMeter. It's great for load testing and analyzing
performance metrics. Understanding how the system behaves under stress is crucial for
our platform.
S: Agreed. Are there any specific practices we follow during the QA phase?
J: Definitely. We emphasize test-driven development (TDD). So, you’ll be expected to
write tests before the actual code. It’s a bit challenging but great for ensuring quality.
