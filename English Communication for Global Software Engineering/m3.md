Asking about
stakeholder feedback

Product 2

In a meeting focused on enhancing Product 2's
Supply Chain Platform, George, the product
manager, discusses how to translate stakeholder
feedback into actionable development tasks with
Daniel, the UX designer, and Hannah, the front-
end developer.

G: Good morning. Today, we need to focus on integrating the recent feedback into our supply chain platform. We've received valuable
insights from our last stakeholder meeting.
D: What kind of feedback are we looking at?
G: We've got suggestions on improving user interfaces for the inventory tracking system and requests for more advanced analytics features.
H: The feedback on the inventory interface is particularly actionable. We've observed that users need clearer navigation and more intuitive
controls.
D: That makes sense. Are we considering a complete overhaul of the UI, or are we focusing on incremental improvements based on the
stakeholder feedback?
H: Incremental improvements for now. Let’s start by simplifying the dashboard layout. Could you explore ways to make the interface more
user-friendly as suggested by the stakeholders?
D: Absolutely. I can draft some initial designs and run them through usability testing to ensure they align with the stakeholder feedback.
G: That's great. Regarding the analytics feature, we need to enhance our data visualization capabilities. The stakeholders want more detailed
and interactive reports. How can we make sure we meet these expectations?
H: I suggest we look into integrating tools like Tableau or Power BI for that purpose. They offer robust data visualization options that
stakeholders are looking for.
D: Integrating those tools will also give us an opportunity to handle larger datasets more effectively. How do we plan to gather and
incorporate ongoing stakeholder feedback on these tools?
G: Excellent point. We can set up regular review sessions with stakeholders to ensure their feedback is continuously integrated. It’s vital that
all these changes align with our overall platform architecture and don’t compromise performance.

    Negative feedback
    Unfavorable feedback

Feedback is ALWAYS singular

FeedbackS = INCORRECT

We are looking at valuable feedback that suggests
improvements in user interfaces for the inventory tracking
system. Users have provided some really useful feedback,
requesting clearer navigation and more intuitive controls.
These suggestions are based on their experiences and the
challenges they have faced while using the current system.

The feedback includes useful suggestions for enhancing
the inventory interface with clearer navigation and more
intuitive controls. Users also expressed the important need
for advanced analytics features to better manage and
interpret their data.

Are we considering a complete overhaul of the
UI, or are we focusing on incremental
improvements based on the stakeholder
feedback?

 Are we planning to redesign the whole UI, or just
make small changes based on feedback?

    Should we change the entire UI,
or improve it step by step using feedback?

To overhaul something = To make big changes
and improvements to something, like fixing and
upgrading it.

Rather than a complete overhaul of the UI, we will
make small changes to improve it step by step.
Simplifying the dashboard layout is our first step
in this process.

Instead of opting for a complete overhaul of the
UI, we are concentrating on incremental
improvements as suggested by the stakeholders.
By making small changes and improving it step
by step, we aim to gradually enhance the system
without disrupting the current user experience
too much.

Could you explore ways to make the interface
more user-friendly as suggested by the

based on stakeholder suggestions?

Improve the interface

Make the interface more user-friendly

Make the interface easier to use

To create / draft some initial designs

“to draft" means to make a first version

Absolutely. I can draft some initial designs and run them
through usability testing to ensure they align with the
stakeholder feedback. We will focus on simplifying the
navigation and making the interface easier to use. This process
will involve several iterations to refine the designs based on
testing results, ensuring that we improve the interface for all
users.

Sure, I will draft some initial designs and conduct usability
tests to make the interface more user-friendly, as suggested by
the stakeholders. This will include adding features that
improve navigation, making the interface easier to use, and
ensuring it meets the usability standards expected by our
users.

How do we plan to gather and incorporate
ongoing stakeholder feedback on these tools?

 How will we collect and use feedback
 from stakeholders for these tools?

    What is our plan to get and apply feedback
from stakeholders on these tools?

How They Are Similar:

    Collect and Gather both mean
to bring things or people TOGETHER.

    “You can collect or gather stamps.”

How They Are Different

Collect is more FORMAL and
often used for organized actions.

“Collect data from the survey.”

Gather is more informal and often used for
bringing things together over time.

Example: Gather feedback from our users.

“to gather feedback
for weeks and months.”

Collect = one simple action

Gather = during a period of time

To gather feedback from the
users / stakeholders

Gather

1: Ga /  The a in “cat”

2: Place the tip of your tongue
between your upper and lower teeth.

Gently blow air out, making a soft sound.
Example: The "th" in "this."

3: Make a soft "er" sound,
Like  in the word  “her."

Gather Feedback

To bring together opinions
 or comments from people.

    “We need to gather feedback from
 customers to improve our product."

Incorporate Feedback

To use the feedback to
make changes or improvements.

“We will incorporate feedback
to make the app better.”

To set Up

To arrange or
organize something.

“We will set up a meeting with the team.”

I need to set up the meeting.
I need to set the meeting up.

I need to set it up.
I need to set up it.

They will set up the new projects.
They will set the new projects up.

They will set them up.
They will set up them.

We plan to gather ongoing stakeholder feedback by
setting up regular review sessions. These sessions will
allow stakeholders to provide their input on the new
tools and features, ensuring their needs are continuously
integrated into the development process.

To incorporate ongoing stakeholder feedback, we will set
up regular review meetings and feedback sessions.
These will give stakeholders the opportunity to share

Asking about features of a
project management tool like
Jira

Product 3

In a training session for Product 3's Real Estate
Portal, Iris, the project manager, explains the use
of Jira for project management to Liam, the front-
end developer, and Max, the technical lead.

I: As we increase our efforts, it’s crucial to understand how to use Jira effectively for
project management. It helps us track progress and collaborate efficiently.
L: I’ve used Jira before, but I'm not completely confident with all its features. Could you
guide me on updating task status and logging requirements?
M: Sure, When you start working on a task, first update its status to ‘In Progress’. This
lets everyone know you’re actively working on it. For logging requirements or
acceptance criteria, you can add them in the task’s description or comments module.
L: What about flagging blockers or dependencies?
I: If you encounter a blocker, flag the task using the ‘Blocker’ label and provide a brief
explanation of the issue. For dependencies, link the relevant tasks using the ‘Link’
feature and note any specific dependencies in the comments.
M: It's also important to log your time spent on each task. This helps in tracking our
project's time allocation and budgeting.
L: How detailed should the time tracking be?
M: Try to be as accurate as possible. Record the time spent each day on the task. This
information is invaluable for our sprint retrospectives and future planning.
I: Yes, and make sure to regularly check the project board for updates on other tasks. It
gives you an overview of the project's progress and any shifts in priorities.
L: That makes sense. I’ll start practicing these steps to get more comfortable with Jira.
M: Remember, the goal is to keep the entire team informed and aligned. Jira is a powerful
tool for that, especially in a project as dynamic as our real estate portal.
I: Exactly. If you have any questions or run into any difficulties, feel free to ask. We’re
here to help each other.

Could you guide me on updating
task status and logging requirements?

How do we manage task status updates
 and requirements documentation?

Can you guide me through the steps for updating
task status and maintaining requirements logs?

Update

To update task status

    update: uhp-dayt
    updates: uhp-dayts

To log requirements

Log

    log: log (rhymes with "dog")
    logging: log-ing

Sure, when you start working on a task,
first update its status to ‘In Progress’. This
lets everyone know you’re actively working
on it. For logging requirements or
acceptance criteria, you can add them in the
task’s description or comments module.

Of course. To update the task status, change
it to ‘In Progress’ once you begin working on
it. For logging requirements, include them in
the task’s description or use the comments
section to detail acceptance criteria and
other necessary information.

What about flagging blockers
 or dependencies?

How should we handle flagging
blockers or dependencies?

Flagging Blockers

    flagging: FLAG-ing
    blockers: BLOK-ers

Flagging Dependencies

    flagging: FLAG-ing
    dependencies: dih-PEN-dən-seez

Identify: Recognize a blocker.
Report: Share information about a blocker.
Flag: Notify urgently about a blocker.
Highlight: Emphasize a blocker.

If you encounter a blocker, identify and flag the
task using the ‘Blocker’ label and provide a brief
explanation of the issue. For dependencies, create
'Task Dependency' issues to link the relevant
tasks using the ‘Link’ feature and note any
specific dependencies in the comments.

To flag blockers, recognize and report the issue
by using the ‘Blocker’ label on the task and
explaining the problem briefly. For dependencies,
you can open 'Task Dependency' issues to link
related tasks using the ‘Link’ feature and add
notes about specific dependencies in the
comments section.

How detailed should
 the time tracking be?

Is there a specific level of detail
we should aim for in time tracking?

What's the appropriate level
of detail for time tracking?

To Log Your Hours
To write down the number
of hours you work.

To Record
To write down or save information
 so you can use it later.

To Track / Keep Track of
To watch and follow the progress
of something over time.

To be accurate = To be correct
and without mistakes.

To do something accurately = Doing something in
a way that is correct and without mistakes.

Accurate: AK-yu-rət

Accurately: AK-yu-rət-lee

Try to be as accurate as possible. Record the time
spent each day on the task. This information is
invaluable for our sprint retrospectives and
future planning. By accurately logging your time,
we can better understand our productivity and
identify any bottlenecks that may be causing
delays.

You should try to be as accurate as you can. Log
the time spent on each task daily. This detailed
tracking is crucial for analyzing our sprint
performance and planning future sprints.
Accurate time tracking helps us allocate
resources more effectively and makes sure we
stay on schedule.
